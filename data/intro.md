### About Me

Hello! My name is Rini Banerjee. 

I'm a final-year student at Imperial College London, studying Joint Mathematics & Computer Science. I am currently working towards an integrated MEng degree, and will be graduating in 2022. 

My interests include program analysis, program verification and compilers. I've worked on a number of software engineering projects over the past few years and have become familiar with a variety of imperative and functional programming languages, including Kotlin, Python, and (most recently) OCaml.

In my free time, I enjoy playing music, both in the Western and Indian classical realms. I also enjoy helping out with Imperial's Women & Non-Binary Individuals in Computing society, where I am currently Secretary.
