### About Me

Hi! My name is Rini and I'm an incoming PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, where I will be supervised by [Prof Peter Sewell](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/) and [Dr Neel Krishnaswami](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~nk480/). My research interests include formal verification, programming languages, compilers and memory models.

I recently graduated from Imperial College London with an MEng degree in Mathematics & Computer Science. My Master's thesis was about formal transactional memory models in the context of non-volatile memory, for which I was supervised by [Dr Azalea Raad](https://www.soundandcomplete.org/). During my time at Imperial, I was actively involved with the [Women & Non-Binary Individuals in Computing society](http://wic.doc.ic.ac.uk/), serving as Secretary in my final year.

I spend most of my free time getting involved with music. I enjoy both listening to and playing a variety of genres, including classical music (both in the Western and Indian realms) as well as more modern music too.
