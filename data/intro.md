### About me

I am a PhD student at the [Computer Laboratory](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), working with [Prof Peter Sewell](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/) and [Prof Neel Krishnaswami](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~nk480/). 

I work as part of the [REMS](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/rems/) group at Cambridge. I am broadly interested in programming languages research, with my current focus being testing and verification for systems software. My work aims to improve the reliability of low-level systems which lie at the software/hardware boundary.

Previously, I did an integrated Master's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where I worked with [Dr Azalea Raad](https://www.soundandcomplete.org/) on formal transactional memory models for non-volatile (persistent) memory.
