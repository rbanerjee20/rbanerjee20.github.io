### About Me

Hi! I am a second-year PhD student at the [Computer Laboratory](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), where I am supervised by [Prof Peter Sewell](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/) and [Prof Neel Krishnaswami](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~nk480/). 

My research interests include formal verification, software testing, compilers and weak memory models. My work aims to improve the reliability of low-level systems which lie at the software/hardware boundary.

Previously, I did an integrated Master's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). For my Master's dissertation, I worked with [Dr Azalea Raad](https://www.soundandcomplete.org/) on formal transactional memory models for non-volatile (persistent) memory.
