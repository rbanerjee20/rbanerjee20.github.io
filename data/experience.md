### Research Internships

I did a number of research internships between 2018 and 2022, both in industry and at my university, Imperial College London. See below to find out what I got up to during each internship.

I developed a number of tools in OCaml for [Sail](https://github.com/rems-project/sail), a specification language that describes the instruction set architecture semantics of processors. I opened [several GitHub issues](https://github.com/rems-project/sail/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Arbanerjee20+is%3Aclosed+) in the Sail repository which led to bug fixes within the Sail compiler and also additional user documentation to be written. For this project, I was supervised by [Dr Martin Berger](https://users.sussex.ac.uk/~mfb21/).

I worked on the [Devito Project](http://devitoproject.org), where Devito is a domain-specific language for symbolic computation in Python. I primarily worked on creating the Devito Book, a set of Jupyter Notebook tutorials in Devito for teaching the finite difference method for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) to engineering students. I used Devito to re-implement existing NumPy PDE solvers using Devito and configured CI/CD for testing & deployment. I wrote a summary of my work in a [Microsoft technical blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/educator-developer-blog/devito-book-summer-project-with-imperial-college-london/ba-p/1655272), which was published towards the end of my internship. For this internship, I was supervised by [Prof Paul Kelly](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~phjk/) and [Dr Gerard Gorman](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/g.gorman).

I created an Android app using Java that monitors user security behaviours on mobile devices. In doing so, I became familiar with Android components such as BroadcastReceivers, Listeners & Handlers. I wrote a 30-page [technical report](/assets/urop_technical_report_2019.pdf) detailing my work from this summer, during which time I was supervised by [Dr Soteris Demetriou](https://soteris.github.io/).
