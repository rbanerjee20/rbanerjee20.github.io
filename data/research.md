### Research 

I work as part of the [REMS](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/rems/) (Rigorous Engineering of Mainstream Systems) group at Cambridge.  

I am broadly interested in programming languages research, with my current focus being testing and verification for systems software. Previously, I have worked on formal memory persistency models.
